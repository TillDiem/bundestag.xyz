Due to the increasing accessibility of studies and more generally knowledge, we lean to becoming more and more presumptuous in our theses.
Not only is the media becoming increasingly polarising, we also tend to identify ourselves and our character with "radical" ideologies.
This poses a severe danger to our culture of discussion.
Obviously it also reverses the epic achievements of the Enlightenment -- but who cares.
What we want to focus on in this article is the value of Demut, a German word derived from the old high German diomuoti, and how its presence was diminished in our post-war era.


While there exists the English word "humility" to describe the state of being humble, it first of all has a negative connotation but more importantly it does not exceed the realm of materialism (at least by itself).
The word diomuoti describes the ethos of a servant.
The most accurate description of the modern interpretation of the word Demut we could come up with is the humbleness towards a deity after amputating the latter.
If you now think "duuuh it's just humbleness then...", read about the amputation of Feynman graphs.
This should give an appropriate understanding of the word.


„Manche verstehen unter Demut eine Enge des Herzens und die platte und kleinmütige Veranlagung eines Menschen, den nur Unwesentliches interessiert.
Andere denken, Demut sei kränkliches Aussehen und Niedrigkeit, die sich in Haltung, Kleidung und Benehmen manifestiert.
Manche verwechseln die Demut mit Feigheit und Furcht, von denen einige beherrscht sind, so daß sie sich nicht an große Dinge wagen.
Schließlich meinen einige, es sei demütig, über keine Fähigkeiten zu verfügen oder die vorhandenen nicht zu nutzen, sondern zu verbergen.
Alle diese Auffassungen sind falsch und haben nichts mit der Demut zu tun.“ - Francisco de Osuna




For any religious or esoteric society the word Demut automatically is a fundamental building block in their moral.
Nevertheless, since the West vehemently follows the sinful path of materialism, we have to plea for another origin of Demut.
In the post-war humanistic western countries, we humans are as important and wise as we make ourselves.
Unfortunately, this new self-perception and its influence on popular science enabled a shitstorm on science itself.
We think of the members of Deutsche Physik, J. Evola, and unfortunately also L. Smith, who apparently felt the need to rid science of its raison d'être (not understanding that their critique on the scientific methods is precisely this).
We note that at least the criticism of J. Evola has a point in the sense that we overvalue our opinions and discoveries that lie in the confined region of knowledge we deal with in sciences.


While Nietzsche did not even understand the word humbleness, Kant wrote that Demut in the philosophical sense, or humilitas moralis as he puts it, means accepting the segregation of what we can perceive and the truth, and the consequential behavior (I would give you a quote, but his sentences are too long and pretentiously written).
Following the lines of Chad Smernax, this accounts to renormalising the value and extent of ones perception, i.e. leaving space for factors we neither know nor understand, and also never will.
If you ever had a discussion with someone that thinks outside of your region of axioms and fails to accept this limitation, you know that is an unbearable character trait that prevents any fruitful confrontation.
Sure, you might not care what other people think of your "social skills" or way of arguing.
The true reason why we deem it necessary to talk about Demut is the opportunity for oneself to widen ones horizon.
Contrary to the belief that Demut limits our ability to grow, it generates the space one needs to get a new view on the things that might bug or confuse us.




As previously stated, this degeneration of our self-awareness was and is strongly influenced by the internet.
First of all, you should stop reading the news; unironically.
Stop letting people whose job is to polarise build your view on the world.
All of the things that actually might be important can be gathered from the corresponding "primary literature".
Be aware that  you read is just the outline of reality seen from the perspective of the author.
As a side note: this is exactly the reason why a meaningful discussion can solely exist between individuals that know the set of maxims they are facing.


You might say that rationality, studies and humanism are the only "logical" incentives to create our axioms.
The problem with this is that they are intrinsically materialistic and thus impeding the realisation of Demut in a society.
Our ancestors developed a rich palette of maxims that we should be thankful to adopt (if you think this is a plea for conservatism, you do not understand the word maxim).
We could continue talking about respecting our ancestors and how the current generation is miserably failing in their duties, but we will leave this for another article.


What we mean to say is that the method one uses to create a set of axioms shall never be based on material things alone.
This will result in a subset of rules that will allow you to accept Demut as one of your character traits.
Moreover, as an atheist you should consider yourself a servant to precisely these maxims.
